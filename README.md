- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cubellia, mostly I do game development. I'm more of an artist than a programmer, heh.
- Big believer in FOSS, and all of my game projects use Godot these days (I'm a Unity expat).
- I would like to learn Haxe someday...
- You can play my games on Itch : https://cubellia.itch.io
- Twitter is still my primary social media: https://twitter.com/cubellia
