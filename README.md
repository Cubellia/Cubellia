- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cubellia, mostly I do game development. I'm more of an artist than a programmer, heh.
- Big believer in FOSS, and all of my game projects use Godot these days (I'm a Unity expat).
- I would like to learn Haxe someday...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... the shavian alphabet! 𐑦𐑑 𐑦𐑟 𐑒𐑲𐑯𐑛 𐑝 𐑣𐑸𐑛!
- You can play my games on Itch : https://cubellia.itch.io
- Twitter is still my primary social media: https://twitter.com/cubellia
- Buuuut I do have a Mastodon just in case: https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@cubellia
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
